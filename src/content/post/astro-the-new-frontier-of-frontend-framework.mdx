## What is Astro?

Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, portfolio, and e-commerce.
With Astro, the way has been opened for a new frontend architecture to reduce the overhead and complexity of JavaScript when loading web pages, making the site fast and SEO friendly.

## The five principles of Astro's philosophy

Astro was designed based on five fundamental principles to explain the need that led to its development and the problems it needs to solve:

- <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven" class="link">Content-driven</a>: Astro was designed to give its all when developing content-focused products.
- <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#server-first" class="link">Server-first</a>: websites run faster when they render HTML on the server.
- <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#fast-by-default" class="link">Fast by default</a>: Astro is all about performance, which is why it is very difficult to create a slow product.
- <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#easy-to-use" class="link">Easy to use</a>: You don‚Äôt need to be an expert to build something with Astro.
- <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#developer-focused" class="link">Developer-focused</a>: the developer has everything he needs for his work at his disposal.

## Main features

Astro includes everything you need to create a website, built-in. There are also hundreds of different integrations and API hooks available to customize a project to your exact use case and needs.
