## Overview
Each website allows you to view so-called "web pages", so that you can interact or find information. In this article, we're going to explore Astro Pages and how they work.

Let's start! ðŸ¤™

## What are Astro Pages?
Astro Pages are files that are responsible for handling routing, data loading, and overall page layout for every page in your website.
They live in the `src/pages/` subdirectory.

```html
---
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Homepage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
The example above shows a very simple Astro Page template.
A page must produce a full HTML document. If not explicitly included, Astro will add the necessary `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and `<head>` content to any `.astro` component located within `src/pages/` by default. You can opt-out of this behavior on a per-component basis by marking it as a partial page.


## Astro Pages with Markdown
All Markdown files within `src/pages/` are treated by Astro as pages of your final website. If the files are `.mdx` rather than `.md`, the end result will be the same.

## Page Partials
Partials are page components located within `src/pages/` that are not intended to render as full pages.
Working closely with third-party frontend libraries, they can be considered alternatives to the [Astro Islands](https://dev.to/dvalin99/pieces-of-interactives-astro-islands-4nnb).
To configure Page Partials, you need to export `const partial = true`, like following example:

```html
---
export const partial = true;
---

<h1>This is partial page!</h1>
```

## Conclusion
Astro Pages are fundamental components for building a static website using Astro: easy to set up and versatile for all types of use.
