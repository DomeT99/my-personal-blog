## Deno

<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" class="link"> Deno</a> is the open-source JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly  runtime for the modern web. Built on web standards with zero-config TypeScript, unmatched security, and a complete built-in toolchain, it is the easiest, most productive way to JavaScript.
It's a most competitor of Node.js, another JavaScript runtime 😌

## Espanso

<a href="https://github.com/espanso/espanso" class="link">  Espanso</a> is Cross-platform Text Expander, program that detects when you type a specific keyword and replaces it with something else.
Espanso is privacy first and cross platform, available for Linux, Windows and macOS 🥳

## Hyperswitch

<a href="https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch" class="link"> Hyperswitch</a> is an open source payments switch written in Rust to make payments fast, reliable and affordable, and integrates well with the largest payment providers (Stripe, Klarna, PayPal...) and you can deploy it to the AWS Cloud 😯

## Starship

<a href="https://github.com/starship/starship" class="link"> Starship</a> is minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell. It's fast, intelligent and easy to install, available for Linux, Windows, macOS and more 🥸

## Diesel

<a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel" class="link"> Diesel</a> is safe, extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust.
It gets rid of the boilerplate for database interaction and eliminates runtime errors without sacrificing performance. It takes full advantage of Rust's type system to create a low overhead query builder that "feels like Rust" 🤙

## Tokio

<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio" class="link"> Tokio</a> is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language.
It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices 👐

## Zola

<a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola" class="link"> Zola</a> is a static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in: it gets out of your way so you can focus on your content, be it a blog, a knowledge base, a landing page or a combination of them 🧠
