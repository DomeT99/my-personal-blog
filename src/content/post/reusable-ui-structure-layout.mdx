## Overview

It may happen during development that you have to reuse the same components for the entire use of the application.
Therefore, without having to import components for each page, it is possible to create Components that act as wrappers: Layouts.
In this article, we'll look at how to use them and how they perform in an Astro project.

Let's start! ðŸ¤™

## What are Layouts?

Layouts are [Astro Components](https://dev.to/dvalin99/build-your-interface-in-astro-components-2gng) used to provide a reusable UI structure, such as a page template.
The term _layout_ is used for components that provide common interface elements that are shared across pages, such as headers, navigation bars, and footers.
They can accept props and import and use other components like any other Astro component. They can include UI frameworks, components, and client-side scripts.
Layout components are commonly placed in a `src/layouts` directory in your project.

```html
---
import Navbar from '../components/BaseHead.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <Navbar title="{title}" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <article>
      <slot />
    </article>
    <footer />
  </body>
</html>
```

`<slot />` tag is important because it is the point where the content will be "injected".

```html
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
---

<BaseLayout title="Home Page">
  <p>Hello from home page!</p>
</BaseLayout>
```

## Markdown layouts

Layouts are especially useful for Markdown and MDX pages which otherwise would not have any page formatting.
Astro provides a special property called `layout` to specify which `.astro` component to use as the page layout.

In general, a tipical Markdown layout includes:

- The `frontmatter` prop to access the Markdown or MDX pageâ€™s frontmatter and other data.

- A default `<slot />` to inject the contents.

```md
---
layout: ../layouts/BaseLayout.astro
title: "A reusable UI structure: Layouts ðŸ’±"
author: "Domenico Tenace"
date: "23 Jun 2024"
---

This is my new article!
```

```html
---
const { frontmatter } = Astro.props;
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{frontmatter.title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{frontmatter.title} by {frontmatter.author}</h1>
    <slot />
    <p>Written on: {frontmatter.date}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Importing Layouts Manually (MDX)
You may need to pass information to your MDX layout that does not exist in your frontmatter. In this case, you can instead import and use a `<Layout />` component and pass it props like any other component:

```md
---
layout: ../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro
title: "My first MDX post"
publishDate: "23 Jun 2024"
---

import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';

export function fancyJsHelper() {
return "Try doing that with YAML!";
}

<BaseLayout title={frontmatter.title} fancyJsHelper={fancyJsHelper}>
  Welcome to my new Astro blog, using MDX!
</BaseLayout>
```

And now, your values are available to you through Astro.props in your layout, and your MDX content will be injected into the page where your `<slot />` component is written:

```html
---
const { title, fancyJsHelper } = Astro.props;
---

<h1>{title}</h1>
<slot />
<p>{fancyJsHelper()}</p>
```

---

## Conclusion

Astro Layouts allow the reuse of basic components that should be recalled for each page of our site. They are also very useful when used in `.md` or `.mdx` files.

Happy coding!âœ¨
